Create listings of open source issues for sprints or other events

The idea for this project came out of a need at [Classic Graphics](https://knowclassic.com). We encourage the devleopment team to work on open source contribution. I am often asked if I have some "good" issues (fit for skill level and benefits Classic) for developers to work on in the open source community, especially on [drupal.org](https://drupal.org). While I keep a number of these issues in OmniFocus, I thought it would be awesome to have a curated list of open source issues.

Another good use case for sprintq is to organize issues for sprints. When you are planning a sprint, just start up a sprintq list and add issues with links to the actual project issues. The list can combine issues from different issue queues and span different types of work (ex: development, documentation, testing, etc.).

During a sprint, just "claim" your issue so others know you are working on it.
